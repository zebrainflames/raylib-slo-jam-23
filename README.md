# Raylib Slo Jam 2023

This is a simple entry to raylib slo jam 2023. Hopefully submitted despite end conditions..?

Repo set up based on my own very old raylib game template available in [[link]]

CMake builds for platform and a python script for building emscripten builds and hosting them (build_and_run_for_web.py) -> first requires making the assumed build dirs and runnig a cmake build into that manually.
